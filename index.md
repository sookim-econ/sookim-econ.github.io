I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/). I plan to receive my Ph.D. in Economics from the [Department of Economics](https://economics.nd.edu) at Notre Dame in May 2025. My research focuses on the intersection of economic development and macroeconomics, with an emphasis on structural transformation, industrialization, and policy evaluation. My Ph.D. advisors are [Joseph Kaboski](https://www3.nd.edu/~jkaboski/)), [Benjamin Pugsley](https://www.benjaminpugsley.com) and [Jasmine Xiao](https://jasmine-xiao.com).

[My Job Market Paper](/uploads/research/heterogenous_unemployment.pdf) examines the effect of financial market inefficiency in shaping the path of structural transformation, and evaluate the industrial policy to alleviate the financial friction. I develop a multisector growth model with asymmetric technolgical growth and financial frictions. By introducing financial frictions, I find that industrialization was delayed by 25 years when calibrated to the United States economy. I further discuss using the South Korean development episode that industrial policy at the right timing could alleviate the negative effects of inefficiency during the path of industrialization.

I am open to opportunities in academic research and teaching, as well as roles in research institutes, economic consulting, and government positions.
